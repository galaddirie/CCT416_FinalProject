There is NO global warming.

There is NO climate crisis.

CO2 is VITAL to all life on earth and its levels are dropping precipitously. They are now dangerously LOW.

Neither CO2 nor mankind can affect or change this planet's climate.

Never have in history.

Never will. https://t.co/Y1Qsv6lbOn",,51
